<!-- RAILS DEVELOPMENT RULES GUIDELINES START -->

# Rails Development Rules - The Rails Way with AI Agents
***Built for: Solo developer + AI agents, maximum joy***

## Core Philosophy
You are building a Rails 8+ application following The Rails Way™. Code should be:
- Convention over configuration
- Database-first design
- Progressive enhancement with Hotwire
- Zero-build frontend approach
- Test-driven with Minitest
- Optimized for AI agent collaboration
- Lean, readable, and maintainable

## Rails 8+ Stack Preferences
- **Authentication**: Devise
- **Background Jobs**: Solid Queue (default Rails 8)
- **Caching**: Solid Cache (database-backed, Redis when needed)
- **WebSockets**: Action Cable with Solid Cable adapter
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Active Record
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) & TailwindCSS
- **Asset Pipeline**: Propshaft (simpler, no-build approach)
- **Testing**: Minitest with fixtures (no RSpec, no factories)
- **Rich Text**: Action Text for content editing
- **File Uploads**: Active Storage with direct uploads
- **Code Quality**: Rubocop Rails Omakase - Omakase Ruby styling for Rails
- **Development Tools**: Bullet gem for N+1 detection, Annotate gem for schema docs, Hotwire Spark gem for live-reloading
- **Error Tracking**: Rails built-in error reporter

## File Organization & Naming

### Consistent Directory Structure
```
app/
├── controllers/
│   ├── concerns/
│   └── application_controller.rb
├── models/
│   ├── concerns/
│   └── application_record.rb
├── views/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── shared/
│   └── [resource_name]/
├── services/
├── jobs/
├── channels/
├── mailers/
└── helpers/
```

### Naming Conventions for AI Agents
- **Classes**: PascalCase, descriptive (`UserRegistrationService`, `InvoicePaymentProcessor`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class name (`user_registration_service.rb`)
- **Methods**: snake_case, verb-first for actions (`process_payment`, `calculate_total`)
- **Variables**: snake_case, noun-first (`current_user`, `payment_amount`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`)

### AI Agent File Patterns
Always organize files predictably:
```
app/models/user.rb                    # Model: singular
app/controllers/users_controller.rb   # Controller: plural + _controller
app/services/user_registration.rb     # Service: domain + action
app/jobs/send_welcome_email_job.rb    # Job: action + _job
app/views/users/index.html.erb        # View: controller/action
```

### AI-Friendly Documentation
- Include purpose statement for AI comprehension
- Document key dependencies and return values
- Specify potential errors and exceptions
- Keep documentation close to code

## Models & Active Record

### Model Design Principles
- Keep models focused on data integrity and business rules
- Use schema annotations (annotate gem) for documentation
- Order model contents consistently: constants, includes, associations, validations, callbacks, scopes, methods
- Implement database constraints to match validations
- Use concerns for shared behavior across models

### Model Best Practices
- Always index foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Use counter caches for association counts
- Implement scopes for common query patterns
- Keep callbacks minimal - prefer service objects for complex logic
- Use `dependent:` options to maintain referential integrity

### Database Design
- Design normalized schemas by default
- Use appropriate PostgreSQL data types
- Implement database-level constraints
- Create partial indexes for performance
- Document complex queries and decisions

## Controllers

### Controller Principles
- Keep controllers thin and focused on HTTP concerns
- Use before_action filters for common setup
- Follow RESTful conventions strictly
- Handle multiple response formats (HTML, Turbo Stream, JSON)
- Implement proper error handling with appropriate status codes

### Controller Patterns
- Always use strong parameters for user input
- Prefer redirect after mutations over render
- Keep business logic in models or service objects
- Use concerns for shared controller behavior
- Implement resourceful routes whenever possible

## Service Objects

### When to Use Service Objects
- Complex business logic spanning multiple models
- External API integrations
- Multi-step processes with transactions
- Operations that don't naturally fit in a model
- Background job logic that needs testing

### Service Object Principles
- Keep services focused on a single operation
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Return meaningful results (success/failure)
- Make services easy to test in isolation
- Include proper error handling

## Testing Philosophy

### The Rails Way of Testing
- Use fixtures over factories for simplicity and speed
- Write system tests for critical user flows
- Unit test models and services thoroughly
- Test controllers only for complex authorization
- Always test happy path and edge cases

### Testing Best Practices
- Keep tests fast and focused
- Use descriptive test names
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Mock external services appropriately
- Maintain high coverage without obsessing

## Background Jobs

### Job Design Principles
- Make all jobs idempotent and retryable

<!-- ACTIVITY STREAMS GUIDELINES START -->
# Activity Streams Domain
The application implements a highly customized, database-first social graph based on the Activity Streams 2.0 (AS2) format.

## Activity
Activities follow the Activity Streams standard and represent the core action in the network.
Every `Activity` has an `#author`, `#user_author` and `#owner`.
- **author:** The Actor (Profile, Group, or Site) that originated the activity.
- **user_author:** The authentication `User` logged in when the Activity was created.
- **owner:** The Actor whose timeline the activity belongs to (e.g., the wall being posted on).

### Threading & Visibility
Activities form threads via `parent`/`children` relationships. Visibility is dictated by `Audiences` (which join Activities to specific `Relations`).

## ActivityAction
A durable, per-actor action an Actor holds over an `ActivityObject` (currently `follow`). Unlike an `Activity` (a one-off event), it is a standing flag toggled via `follow!`/`unfollow!`.

## Actor
An `Actor` represents a node in the social graph.
**IMPORTANT:** The application uses Rails 8 `delegated_type :actorable` to handle polymorphism. The current subtypes are:
- `Profile` (represents an individual's social presence)
- `Group` (represents a collective entity)
- `Site` (represents the application itself)

*Note: The Devise `User` is strictly for authentication and is NOT an Actor. Users act in the network through their associated `Profile`.*

## ActivityObject
The `ActivityObject` is the target receiving actions (e.g., a Post being liked).
The application uses Rails 8 `delegated_type :objectable` for polymorphism. Subtypes include `Post`, `Profile`, and `Group`.

## Contacts and Ties (The Social Graph)
- **Contact:** An ordered pair of Actors (Sender → Receiver). It is essentially a request or connection attempt. Its `#inverse` is the opposite-direction Contact, used to tell whether a connection has been reciprocated (`#replied?`).
- **Relation:** Defines the role/type of a connection (e.g., `Follow`, `Public`, `Custom`). Uses STI (`Relation::Public`, `Relation::Follow`, etc). Relations are **positive** (real connections: Custom, Public, Follow, Owner, LocalAdmin) or **negative** (`Relation::Reject`, which records a rejection and creates no Activity).
- **Tie:** The materialization of a connection. A `Tie` joins a `Contact` with a `Relation`, officially granting the `Permissions` tied to that Relation.

## Audiences
Sharing is modeled by join records that connect content to `Relations`:
- **Audience:** joins an `Activity` to a `Relation`.
- **ActivityObjectAudience:** joins an `ActivityObject` to a `Relation`.
Each `Relation` stands for the set of Actors holding a `Tie` of that relation, so audiences define who can reach the content.

## Permissions
Authorization in the network is extremely granular. `Permissions` are composed of an `action` (e.g., create, read, update, follow) and an `object` (e.g., activity, tie, post).
Permissions are attached to `Relations`. When Actor A creates a `Tie` with Actor B using a specific Relation, Actor B is granted all Permissions defined in that Relation.
