#

# An {Activity} follows the {https://activitystrea.ms/ Activity Streams} standard: it records
# something an actor did (e.g. "John liked this post"). The action itself is the {#verb}.
#
# Every activity distinguishes three roles:
# * *author* — the {Actor} that originated the activity (posted, liked, etc.).
# * *user_author* — the {User} logged in when the activity was created. When a user acts on
#   behalf of another entity (e.g. a {Group}), the user_author still points to that user.
# * *owner* — the {Actor} whose wall the activity lands on (whose post was liked, etc.).
#
# == Audiences and visibility
# An activity is attached to one or more {Relation Relations} through {Audience Audiences},
# which define who can reach it. With a {Relation::Public public relation} everyone can see it;
# with {Relation::Custom custom relations} only the actors holding a {Tie} of that relation can.
# See {#public?} and {#visible_to?}.
#
# == Threading
# Activities form a tree through +parent+/+children+ (a comment or like is a child of the
# activity it targets), rather than a flat list.
#
# @see ActivityObject The content ({Post}, actor, etc.) an activity is about.
# @see Audience       The join with relations that defines visibility.
# @see Relation       The audience/permission rules.
