# A {Relation} defines the *type* of a {Tie} between two {Actor Actors} (friend, follower,
# public, etc.). It is the bridge between the social graph and authorization: relations carry
# {Permission Permissions}, so establishing a {Tie} grants the receiver the permissions of its
# relation.
#
# == Relation types
# Relations use Single Table Inheritance. The subclasses are:
# * {Relation::Custom}     — user-defined relations, owned by an {Actor} and given a name and permissions.
# * {Relation::Public}     — the default relation for public activities; readable by everyone.
# * {Relation::Follow}     — grants create/read activity and the +follow+ permission.
# * {Relation::Owner}      — full permissions of a {Group} owner.
# * {Relation::LocalAdmin} — administrative permissions over the {Site}.
# * {Relation::Reject}     — marks that a subject does not want to connect; creates no activity.
# * {Relation::Single}     — abstract base for the system-wide (unowned) relations above.
#
# == Relations and audiences
# Each {Activity} is attached to one or more relations through {Audience Audiences}. This
# defines who can reach the activity and the {Permission Permissions} that rule that access.
#
# @see Tie        The link whose type is a relation.
# @see Permission The action/object pairs a relation grants.
# @see Audience   How relations gate access to activities.
