# A {Contact} is an ordered pair of {Actor Actors}: a +sender+ and a +receiver+.
#
# A {Contact} on its own does *not* imply a real link between the two actors. It is created
# for convenience (e.g. by {Actor#suggestions}) and the actual link is stored as one or more
# {Tie Ties}. When Alice adds Bob, a {Contact} from Alice to Bob is created together with a
# {Tie} carrying the {Relation} she chose.
#
# == Inverse contacts
# The inverse of the {Contact} from Alice to Bob is the {Contact} from Bob to Alice
# (see {#inverse}). Inverse contacts let us know whether a contact has been *replied*
# (see {#replied?}), for instance when Bob adds Alice back.
#
# @see Tie      The materialized link that makes a contact active.
# @see Relation The type carried by each tie.
