# An {Actor} represents a social entity: an individual ({Profile}), a {Group} or the
# {Site} itself. Actors are the *nodes* of the social network.
#
# Two actors are linked by {Tie Ties}. The type of a {Tie} is a {Relation}, and each
# actor can define and customize its own {Relation::Custom custom relations}. Actors
# perform {ActivityAction actions} (follow, like, etc.) on {ActivityObject activity objects}.
#
# == Actor subtypes (Subjects)
# The concrete subtype of an actor is called a *Subject*. It is resolved through Rails'
# +delegated_type :actorable+ and can be a {Profile}, a {Group} or a {Site}. Use {#subject}
# to reach the delegated record and {#subject_type} for its class name.
#
# @see Contact  The ordered pair of actors.
# @see Tie      The materialized link between two actors.
# @see Relation The type of a Tie, which carries {Permission Permissions}.
# @see Activity How actors publish and share content.
