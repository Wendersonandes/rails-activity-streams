# A {Permission} is the unit of authorization in the network. It is a pair of *action* and
# *object* (e.g. +read activity+, +create post+, +follow+). Permissions are assigned to
# {Relation Relations} through {RelationPermission}, so when an actor establishes a {Tie}
# with a given relation, its receiver is granted the relation's permissions.
#
# == Actions
# +create+, +read+, +update+, +destroy+, +follow+ (subscribe to updates) and +represent+
# (act on behalf of another actor).
#
# == Objects
# +activity+, +tie+, +post+, +comment+. A +nil+ object applies the action broadly (e.g. +follow+).
#
# @see Relation           The role permissions are attached to.
# @see RelationPermission The join model between relations and permissions.
