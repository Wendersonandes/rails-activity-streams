# Base class for all {https://github.com/varvet/pundit Pundit} authorization policies. It
# defines a deny-by-default contract: every action returns +false+ unless a subclass overrides
# it.
#
# Two identities are available to subclasses:
# * +user+ — the authenticated {User} (the login identity), or +nil+ when signed out.
# * {#actor} — the {Actor} the user is currently acting as ({User#current_profile}). This is
#   the entity checked against the social graph and {Permission Permissions}.
#
# In this application, policies replace the permission checks that the legacy engine performed
# through ties and roles: authorization questions about the graph are delegated to model
# methods such as +Activity#visible_to?+ or +Actor#has_relation_with?+.
