# Base controller for the whole application. It wires up the authorization backbone shared by
# every request:
#
# * {https://github.com/varvet/pundit Pundit} — enforces that every non-Devise action calls
#   +authorize+ (+verify_authorized+) and that every +index+ resolves a policy scope
#   (+verify_policy_scoped+). Controllers that legitimately opt out use +skip_after_action+.
# * {https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy Pagy} — pagination helpers.
# * Devise — +authenticate_user!+ guards all actions unless a controller skips it.
#
# The distinction between the login identity and the acting graph node lives here: +current_user+
# is the {User}, while {#current_actor} is the {Actor} it currently acts as
# ({User#current_profile}) — the value passed to policies and used across the domain.
#
# @see ApplicationPolicy The Pundit base that mirrors this +user+ vs +actor+ split.
