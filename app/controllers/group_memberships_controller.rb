# Manages the membership lifecycle of a {Group}: listing members by role, join requests and
# invites, role changes, removals and leaving, plus an insights dashboard.
#
# Membership is modeled as {Tie Ties} between the group's {Actor} and each member's actor, so
# role changes are delegated to {GroupMembershipService}. Authorization goes through
# {GroupPolicy} using named checks ({GroupPolicy#add_member?}, {GroupPolicy#join?},
# {GroupPolicy#change_role?}, {GroupPolicy#remove_member?}, {GroupPolicy#leave?}).
